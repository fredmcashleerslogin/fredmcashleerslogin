A personal loan is money borrowed from a lender that can be used for nearly any purpose. Common reasons include paying off debt, financing a large purchase such as a vehicle or a boat, or covering the cost of a major expense like a wedding or a home renovation.

You can get a personal loan from online lenders, banks and credit unions, and the funds are provided in a lump sum. Once you receive the cash, you must make recurring, monthly payments until the debt has been fully repaid.

One of the biggest benefits of a personal loan is that they often charge lower fixed interest rates when compared to other forms of lending, like credit cards.
