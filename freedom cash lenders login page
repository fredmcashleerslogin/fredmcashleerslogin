A personal loan is money you borrow from a bank or other financial institution with a set repayment period and consistent monthly payments. Most personal loans are unsecured, so you won’t have to put down collateral to borrow the money.

Loan amounts vary widely, typically from around $1,000 to $50,000 or more, and interest rates currently range from about 6 percent to 36 percent. Repayment terms typically range from one to seven years.

If you’re looking to get a personal loan, you’ll have to complete an application and wait for approval — a process that may take anywhere from a few hours to several days. Once you’re approved, the lender will disburse money into your bank account. You will also start to repay the money. Throughout the loan term, your lender will likely report your account activity to the credit bureaus, so making on-time payments is crucial to building a positive credit history.
